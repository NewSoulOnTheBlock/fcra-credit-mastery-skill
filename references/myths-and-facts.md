# Credit Score Myths vs Facts

## Myth: Checking your own credit hurts your score
**Fact:** Checking your own credit is a "soft pull" — zero impact on score. Only hard inquiries from applications affect your score.

## Myth: You need to carry a balance to build credit
**Fact:** You do NOT need to carry a balance or pay interest. Pay your statement balance in full every month. The statement balance (reported before you pay) is what counts for utilization.

## Myth: Closing old cards helps your score
**Fact:** Closing cards HURTS your score. It reduces your total available credit (increasing utilization) and eventually removes the account's age from your average. Never close your oldest card — product change it to a no-fee version instead.

## Myth: All debt is bad for your score
**Fact:** Having accounts and using them responsibly is BETTER than having no credit. A mortgage with on-time payments significantly boosts your score over time.

## Myth: Paying off a collection removes it from your report
**Fact:** Paying a collection changes the status to "paid" but the collection STAYS on your report for 7 years from the original delinquency date. Exception: "Pay for delete" agreements where the collector agrees in writing to remove the account upon payment.

## Myth: Income affects your credit score
**Fact:** Income is NOT a factor in FICO or VantageScore calculations. A person earning $30K can have a higher score than someone earning $300K. Scores are purely based on credit behavior.

## Myth: You have one credit score
**Fact:** You have dozens of scores. FICO alone has 28+ scoring models. Each bureau may have different data, producing different scores. The score you see on Credit Karma (VantageScore 3.0) is different from what most lenders use (FICO 8 or FICO 9).

## Myth: Married couples share credit scores
**Fact:** Credit scores are individual. Marriage does NOT merge scores. However, joint accounts appear on both spouses' reports, and authorized user accounts cross over.

## Myth: Debit cards build credit
**Fact:** Debit cards are NOT reported to credit bureaus and do NOT build credit. Only credit products (credit cards, loans) build credit history.

## Myth: Employers can see your credit score
**Fact:** Employers see a modified credit REPORT (not the score). The report they see doesn't include your score, account numbers, or certain protected information. They also need your written permission.

## Myth: Credit repair companies can remove accurate negative info
**Fact:** No one can legally remove accurate information from your credit report. Any company promising to do so is likely running a scam. You can do everything a credit repair company does — for free — using the dispute process.

## Myth: Bankruptcy means no credit for 10 years
**Fact:** You can start rebuilding credit immediately after bankruptcy. Secured cards and credit builder loans are available right away. Many people reach 700+ within 2–3 years of bankruptcy discharge.

## Myth: Hard inquiries are devastating
**Fact:** A single hard inquiry typically drops your score 5–10 points and stops affecting your score after ~12 months. Multiple inquiries for the same type of credit (mortgage, auto, student loan) within 14–45 days count as ONE inquiry.

## Myth: You should keep utilization at exactly 0%
**Fact:** 0% utilization across ALL cards can actually score slightly lower than 1–9% utilization. FICO wants to see that you're using credit — just responsibly. The AZEO method (All Zero Except One) is optimal.

## FICO vs VantageScore

| Feature | FICO | VantageScore |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Used by lenders | ~90% of lenders | ~10% of lenders |
| Score range | 300–850 | 300–850 |
| Minimum history | 6 months | 1 month |
| Where you see it | Mortgage/auto/card applications | Credit Karma, free monitoring |
| Hard inquiry window | 45 days (mortgage), 14 days (other) | 14 days (all) |
| Collections handling | FICO 9 ignores paid collections | VS 3.0/4.0 ignores paid collections |
| Authorized user | Counted (slightly less weight) | Counted |

**Bottom line:** Focus on FICO. It's what matters when you apply for credit.
