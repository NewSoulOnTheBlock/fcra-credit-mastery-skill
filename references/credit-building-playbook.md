# Credit Building Playbook

## The Five Levers (in order of impact)

### 1. Payment History (35%) — The Foundation
**Rule:** Never miss a payment. Ever. One 30-day late payment can drop a 780 score by 90–110 points.
- Set up autopay for minimum payment on every account
- Set calendar reminders 5 days before due dates
- If you miss a payment by <30 days, pay immediately — it won't report to bureaus until 30+ days late
- If already late: negotiate with creditor for "goodwill removal" — write a letter, be polite, reference payment history
- Late payments lose impact over time — a 3-year-old late hurts much less than a 3-month-old one

### 2. Credit Utilization (30%) — The Quick Win
**Rule:** Keep utilization under 30% overall and per-card. Ideal: 1–9%.

**Utilization = (Balance ÷ Credit Limit) × 100**

Utilization has NO memory — only the current snapshot matters. You can fix it in one billing cycle.

**Tactics:**
- Pay down before statement closing date (not just due date) — statement balance is what reports
- Request credit limit increases every 6 months (online or phone — ask if it's a soft pull first)
- Spread spending across multiple cards instead of maxing one
- **AZEO (All Zero Except One):** Pay all cards to $0, leave one card reporting $5–$20 balance. This produces the mathematically optimal score.
- **Balance reporting dates:** Each card reports to bureaus on a different date (usually statement closing date). Time payments accordingly.

### 3. Length of Credit History (15%) — The Long Game
**Key metrics:**
- Age of oldest account
- Average age of all accounts
- Age of newest account

**Tactics:**
- Never close your oldest card — product change to a no-fee version instead
- If you're new: become authorized user on a parent/spouse's oldest card (the account's full history backdates to your report)
- Opening new accounts lowers average age — be strategic about timing
- Sock-drawer old cards: use them once every 6–12 months to prevent closure for inactivity

### 4. Credit Mix (10%) — Diversity Matters
FICO rewards having different account types:
- **Revolving:** Credit cards, store cards, HELOCs
- **Installment:** Auto loans, student loans, personal loans, mortgage
- **Open:** Charge cards (pay in full each month)

**Tactics:**
- If you only have cards → add a credit builder loan ($25–$50/month)
- Don't take on debt just for mix — only add accounts you need
- A single installment loan + 2–3 credit cards = solid mix

### 5. New Credit/Inquiries (10%) — Minimize Damage
**Hard inquiry impact:** 5–10 points per inquiry, falls off in 2 years, stops affecting score after ~12 months.

**Tactics:**
- Rate shopping window: Multiple inquiries for same loan type within 14–45 days count as ONE inquiry
- Pre-qualification tools (Capital One, Discover, Amex) use soft pulls — no impact
- Space new applications 6+ months apart
- Don't apply for credit you don't need

## Timeline: Zero to 750+

### Months 1–3: Foundation
- Open secured card (Discover It Secured or Capital One Secured)
- Become authorized user on trusted person's oldest card
- Open credit builder loan (Self.inc — $25/month)
- Set ALL to autopay
- Use secured card for one small recurring charge ($10–$30)
- Pay statement balance in full each month

### Months 3–6: First Score Emerges
- FICO score generates after 6 months of history
- Keep utilization under 10%
- Request CLI on secured card
- Continue perfect payments

### Months 6–12: Building
- Apply for first unsecured card (Discover It Student or Capital One QuicksilverOne)
- Graduate secured card to unsecured (get deposit back)
- Begin AZEO strategy
- Pull all 3 reports — dispute any errors

### Months 12–24: Acceleration
- Apply for a better rewards card
- Request CLI increases across all cards
- Use Experian Boost (utility/phone/streaming payments)
- Continue perfect payments
- Target: 670–720

### Months 24–36: Optimization
- Stop opening new accounts — let age grow
- Maintain <5% utilization
- Consider a small installment loan for mix (if needed)
- Target: 720–750

### Months 36+: Maintenance
- Open new accounts only when genuinely needed
- Keep oldest accounts open forever
- Maintain autopay on everything
- Target: 750–800+

## Authorized User Strategy (Deep Dive)

This is the single most powerful hack in credit building.

**How it works:** When added as AU, the account's FULL history (open date, payment history, limit) appears on your report as if it were your own.

**Ideal AU account:**
- 10+ years old
- $10,000+ credit limit
- 0% utilization (or very low)
- Perfect payment history
- No late payments ever

**Rules:**
- You don't need the physical card
- The primary cardholder's score is NOT affected by adding you
- You can be removed at any time (account disappears from your report within 30–60 days)
- Some lenders (Amex) may not report AU accounts to all bureaus — verify
- FICO models weigh AU accounts slightly less than primary accounts, but the history still helps significantly
