Since that time, I have maintained a perfect payment record and

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

   all three bureaus

   - Itemized statement from the original provider
   - Proof that insurance was properly billed and exhausted
   - Name and address of the original medical provider

Under HIPAA, my protected health information cannot be disclosed
without proper authorization. If you cannot provide a valid HIPAA
authorization bearing my signature, you are in possession of my
PHI illegally and must cease collection and delete any credit
reporting immediately.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
```

of [your state], which is [X] years for this type of debt.

Under [State] law, this debt is time-barred and legally
unenforceable through the courts. Any attempt to collect on a

violation of the FDCPA.

Nothing in this letter constitutes an acknowledgment of this

### Letter 16: Arbitration Election Letter
- **Use when:** Your credit card or loan agreement contains a binding arbitration clause
- **Send to:** Creditor or collector
- **Legal basis:** Federal Arbitration Act + terms of the contract
- **Strategy:** Electing arbitration shifts leverage because the company must pay arbitration fees ($1,500–$3,000+). Many will settle rather than pay. Works especially well for small disputes where litigation costs exceed the debt

| Wrong info on credit report | Letter 1 (Basic Dispute) | Letter 10 (Direct Creditor) |
| Bureau verified wrong info | Letter 3 (611 Reinvestigation) | Letter 4 (Method of Verification) |
| Collection from unknown company | Letter 6 (Debt Validation) | Letter 7 (Cease & Desist) |
| Old collection, willing to pay | Letter 8 (Pay-for-Delete) | Letter 11 (Charge-Off Settlement) |
| Legitimate late, good history | Letter 9 (Goodwill) | — |
| Fraudulent account | Letter 5 (Identity Theft) | Police report + FTC affidavit |
| Inquiry you didn't authorize | Letter 12 (Unauthorized Inquiry) | — |
| Medical collection | Letter 13 (HIPAA Dispute) | Letter 6 (Debt Validation) |

| Unauthorized credit card charge | Letter 17 (Billing Error) | — |
| Business broke agreement | Letter 18 (Breach of Contract) | Letter 19 (Demand Letter) |

## Escalation Path

```
Step 1: Basic Bureau Dispute (Letter 1)
  ↓ If "verified" →
Step 2: 609 Verification (Letter 2) + 611 Reinvestigation (Letter 3)
  ↓ If still "verified" →
Step 3: Method of Verification Demand (Letter 4) + Direct Creditor Dispute (Letter 10)
  ↓ If no resolution →
Step 4: CFPB Complaint (consumerfinance.gov/complaint)
  ↓ If no resolution →
Step 5: Intent to Sue (Letter 15) or Arbitration Election (Letter 16)
  ↓ If no resolution →
Step 6: FCRA Attorney (contingency — defendant pays your fees if you win)
```

## Universal Rules

1. **ALWAYS send certified mail with return receipt** — creates legal proof
2. **NEVER dispute online** — waives some FCRA rights, limits documentation
3. **ONE item per letter** — multiple items can be dismissed as "frivolous"
4. **NEVER send originals** — copies only
5. **Keep a dispute log** — date sent, tracking number, date received, response date, outcome
6. **Track the 30-day deadline** — if bureau misses it, item must be deleted BY LAW
7. **Save everything** — every letter, every response, every envelope, every tracking receipt
8. **NEVER acknowledge a debt is yours** in SOL or validation letters
9. **NEVER pay a collector** without written deletion agreement first
10. **Re-pull reports 30 days after resolution** — verify changes on all 3 bureaus
