# Dispute Strategies & Templates

## The Dispute Hierarchy (Escalation Path)

### Level 1: Direct Bureau Dispute
- Send certified mail with return receipt to all 3 bureaus
- Bureau has 30 days to investigate (45 if you provide new info)
- If unverifiable → must be deleted

### Level 2: Direct Furnisher Dispute (§ 1681s-2(b))
- Write directly to the creditor/furnisher
- They must investigate independently of the bureau process
- Often more effective because you're dealing with the source

### Level 3: CFPB Complaint
- File at consumerfinance.gov/complaint
- Company MUST respond within 15 days
- CFPB tracks complaints — companies fear regulatory attention
- 97% of complaints get a response

### Level 4: Attorney General Complaint
- File with your state AG's consumer protection division
- Some states have stronger credit reporting laws than federal

### Level 5: FCRA Attorney
- Most work on contingency (no upfront cost)
- If you win, defendant pays your attorney fees
- Statutory damages: $100–$1,000 per willful violation
- Punitive damages available for willful violations
- Find attorneys: NACA (National Association of Consumer Advocates)

## When to Dispute

**Always dispute:**
- Accounts that aren't yours
- Incorrect balances or credit limits
- Wrong account status (showing open when closed, or vice versa)
- Incorrect payment history (late payments that were on time)
- Accounts past the 7-year reporting period
- Duplicate accounts
- Hard inquiries you didn't authorize
- Incorrect personal information (wrong name, address, employer)
- Accounts opened through identity theft
- Collections for debts you don't owe

**Strategic disputes:**
- Collections under $100 (some scoring models ignore these)
- Medical collections (often have billing errors)
- Old collections (weaker documentation over time)
- Accounts from companies that no longer exist (hard to verify)

This late payment is significantly impacting my ability to [specific

## Pro Tips

1. **Always send certified mail with return receipt** — creates legal proof of delivery
2. **Never dispute online** — online disputes waive some of your FCRA rights (forced arbitration, limited documentation)
3. **Dispute one item per letter** — multiple items in one letter can get dismissed as "frivolous"
4. **Include supporting documentation** — but never send originals, only copies
5. **Keep a dispute log** — date sent, date received, response date, outcome
6. **If bureau claims "verified"** — request method of verification (§ 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii))
7. **Track the 30-day deadline** — if bureau misses it, the item must be deleted by law
8. **After deletion: re-pull reports in 30 days** — verify it's actually gone from all 3 bureaus
