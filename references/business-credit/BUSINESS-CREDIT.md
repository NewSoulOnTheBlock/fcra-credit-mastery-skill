# Business Credit Mastery — The Entrepreneur's Credit Playbook

Complete guide to building business credit separate from personal credit, leveraging the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and scaling credit access for your business.

## Why Business Credit Matters

Personal credit has a ceiling. Business credit doesn't. A business with strong credit can access:
- **Net-30/60/90 vendor terms** — buy now, pay later (interest-free)
- **Business credit cards** — $50K–$500K+ limits, not tied to personal income
- **SBA loans** — up to $5M with government backing
- **Business lines of credit** — revolving credit for operations
- **Equipment financing** — fund growth without cash outlay
- **Commercial real estate** — buy property under the business entity

The key advantage: **business credit doesn't appear on your personal credit report** (when structured correctly). Your personal utilization stays low while your business leverages hundreds of thousands in credit.

## The Business Credit Ecosystem

### Three Business Credit Bureaus

| Bureau | Score Range | Score Name | What They Track |
|--------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)** | 0–100 | PAYDEX | Payment history to vendors/suppliers |
| **Experian Business** | 0–100 | Intelliscore Plus | Credit risk, payment behavior, public records |
| **Equifax Business** | 101–992 | Business Credit Risk Score | Payment index, credit utilization, public records |

### How Business Scores Work

**D&B PAYDEX (most important for vendor credit):**
- 80–100: Pays on time or early (this is the target)
- 70–79: Pays 15 days late
- 50–69: Pays 30 days late
- 0–49: Pays 60+ days late

**The trick:** PAYDEX rewards early payment. Pay 1 day early = 80. Pay 30 days early = 100. This is the opposite of personal credit where timing doesn't matter as long as you're not late.

**Experian Intelliscore Plus (0–100):**
- 76–100: Low risk
- 51–75: Low-medium risk
- 26–50: Medium risk
- 11–25: Medium-high risk
- 1–10: High risk

**Factors:** Payment history, credit utilization, company age, industry risk, public records, collections, liens, judgments.

## Phase 0: Business Foundation (Before Credit)

Before applying for any business credit, you need a legitimate business entity. Lenders check all of these.

### Entity Checklist

| Step | What | Why | Cost |
|------|------|-----|------|
| 1 | **Register LLC or Corporation** | Separates business from personal liability | $50–$500 (state dependent) |
| 2 | **Get an EIN (Employer ID Number)** | Business SSN — required for all credit apps | Free (IRS.gov) |
| 3 | **Open a business bank account** | Proves the business is real and operating | $0–$25 |
| 4 | **Get a DUNS Number** | D&B identifier — required for most business credit | Free (dnb.com) |
| 5 | **Set up a business phone number** | Listed number under business name (Google Voice works) | $0–$20/mo |
| 6 | **Business address** | Matches across all registrations (virtual office OK) | $0–$100/mo |
| 7 | **Business website** | Professional domain with business email | $10–$20/yr |
| 8 | **State/local licenses** | Whatever your state/city requires | Varies |

### Critical: Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)

Every registration, application, and profile must use the **exact same**:
- Business legal name (as registered with the state)
- Business address
- Business phone number
- EIN

One inconsistency can delay or deny credit applications. Lenders cross-reference everything.

### Getting Your DUNS Number

1. Go to dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html
2. Apply for free (takes 30 days) OR pay ~$229 for expedited (1-2 days)
3. Once assigned, your D&B business credit file is created
4. Self-report basic company info: legal name, address, phone, SIC/NAICS code, employee count, revenue

---

## Phase 1: Starter Vendor Credit (Months 1–3)

These vendors extend Net-30 terms to new businesses with NO credit history and report to business credit bureaus.

### Tier 1 Vendors (Easy Approval, Reports to Bureaus)

| Vendor | What They Sell | Terms | Reports To | Min. Requirements |
|--------|---------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Uline** | Shipping/packaging/office supplies | Net-30 | D&B | EIN + DUNS + 1st order on credit card |
| **Quill** (Staples subsidiary) | Office supplies | Net-30 | D&B, Experian | EIN + DUNS |
| **Grainger** | Industrial/safety supplies | Net-30 | D&B | EIN + DUNS |
| **Crown Office Supplies** | Office supplies | Net-30 | D&B, Experian, Equifax | EIN + DUNS |
| **Strategic Network Solutions** | Tech accessories | Net-30 | D&B, Experian | EIN + DUNS |
| **Summa Office Supplies** | Office supplies | Net-30 | D&B, Experian, Equifax | EIN + DUNS |
| **The CEO Creative** | Marketing materials | Net-30 | D&B, Experian, Equifax | EIN + DUNS + $49 fee |
| **Shirtsy** | Custom apparel | Net-30 | D&B, Equifax | EIN + DUNS |

### The Strategy:

1. Open accounts with **5+ Tier 1 vendors** in the first 30 days
2. Make a small purchase on each ($50–$200)
3. **Pay EARLY** — don't wait for the Net-30 deadline. Pay within 1–5 days
4. Paying early builds your PAYDEX score fastest (early payment = higher score)
5. After 3 months of early payments, you'll have 5+ trade lines and a PAYDEX of 80+

### What to Buy:
Don't buy things you don't need. Buy things you'd buy anyway:
- Office supplies (paper, pens, toner)
- Shipping supplies (boxes, tape, labels)
- Cleaning supplies
- Safety equipment
- Custom business cards or shirts

---

## Phase 2: Business Credit Cards (Months 3–6)

Once you have 5+ vendor trade lines with 3 months of payment history, you qualify for business credit cards.

### Tier 2: Store/Fleet Cards (Easier Approval)

| Card | Reports To | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Shell Small Business Card** | D&B, Experian | Gas/fleet card, easy approval |
| **BP Business Solutions** | D&B | Fleet fuel card |
| **Home Depot Pro** | D&B | Building supplies |
| **Lowe's Business Advantage** | D&B, Experian | Building supplies |
| **Amazon Business Line** | D&B | Amazon purchases |
| **Sam's Club Business** | D&B | Wholesale purchases |

### Tier 3: Major Business Credit Cards (Months 4–6)

| Card | Typical Limit | Personal Guarantee? | Reports To |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Brex** | $5K–$300K | NO PG | D&B, Experian |
| **Divvy (Bill.com)** | $5K–$50K | Soft pull, no PG option | D&B |
| **Ramp** | $5K–$500K | NO PG | D&B |
| **Capital One Spark** | $5K–$50K | PG required | D&B, Experian |
| **Chase Ink Business** | $5K–$50K | PG required | D&B (not personal report) |
| **Amex Business Gold** | No preset limit | PG required | D&B, Experian (not personal report*) |

*Amex Business cards don't report to personal bureaus UNLESS you default.

### No Personal Guarantee (No PG) Cards — The Goal

These cards are approved based on business financials ONLY:
- **Brex** — requires $50K+ in a business bank account OR $1M+ annual revenue
- **Ramp** — requires $75K+ in business bank account
- **Divvy** — more flexible, uses business cash flow
- **Net-30 accounts** — none require PG

The path: Vendor credit → Store cards (with PG) → Major cards (with PG) → No PG cards

## Phase 3: Business Lines of Credit & Loans (Months 6–12)

|--------|--------|-------------|

## Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) — Your Legal Shield

### What It Is
15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq. — Prohibits discrimination in ANY credit transaction, including business credit.

### Protected Classes
Creditors CANNOT discriminate based on:
- Race or color
- Religion
- National origin
- Sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation per recent CFPB guidance)
- Marital status
- Age (if applicant has capacity to contract)
- Receipt of public assistance income
- Good-faith exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act

### ECOA Applies to Business Credit Too
This is the part most entrepreneurs don't know. **Regulation B (12 CFR Part 1002) explicitly covers business credit transactions.** A bank cannot deny your business loan application based on any protected characteristic.

### Your Rights Under ECOA

**1. Right to Equal Evaluation**
- Creditors must evaluate your application using the same criteria they use for everyone
- Cannot apply different standards based on protected status
- Cannot discourage you from applying based on protected status

**2. Right to Adverse Action Notice (30 days)**
When denied business credit, the creditor MUST:
- Provide written notice of the action taken
- State the specific reason(s) for denial (or tell you how to get them)
- Identify the credit bureau used (if applicable)
- Inform you of your ECOA rights

**3. Right to Know Why**
You can request (and they must provide) the specific reasons:
- "Insufficient business revenue" — acceptable
- "You don't seem like the type of person we lend to" — ECOA violation
- "We don't lend to businesses in your neighborhood" — potential redlining violation

**4. Right to Include All Income**
Creditors must consider:
- All reliable income sources (including public assistance, alimony, veteran's benefits)
- Part-time income
- Self-employment income
- Cannot require spouse's signature unless the spouse is also applying or the business is jointly owned

**5. Right to Sue**
If ECOA is violated:
- **Individual action:** Actual damages + punitive damages up to $10,000
- **Class action:** Actual damages + punitive damages up to the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of creditor's net worth
- **Attorney's fees and court costs** — paid by the defendant if you win
- **Statute of limitations:** 5 years from the date of the violation (2 years for federal agencies)
- **Report violations to:** CFPB (consumerfinance.gov/complaint), DOJ Civil Rights Division, or your state AG

### ECOA + Business Credit: Common Violations

| Violation | Example | Your Response |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Discouragement | "We don't typically lend to people like you" | File CFPB complaint + consult attorney |
| Different terms | Higher rate than equally qualified applicant of different race | Request adverse action notice, compare terms, file complaint |
| Spousal requirement | "We need your wife to cosign" (on sole-owner LLC) | ECOA violation — spouse signature cannot be required unless jointly applying |
| Income discrimination | Refusing to count public assistance as income | ECOA violation — all reliable income must be considered |
| Redlining | "We don't serve businesses in that zip code" | DOJ Combating Redlining Initiative — file complaint with DOJ + CFPB |
| No adverse action notice | Denied with no explanation | ECOA violation — demand written explanation within 30 days |

### Regulation B Key Sections

| Section | What It Covers |
|---------|---------------|
| § 1002.2 | Definitions (applicant, creditor, credit transaction) |
| § 1002.4 | Discrimination prohibited |
| § 1002.5 | Rules on requesting information (what they can/can't ask) |
| § 1002.6 | Rules on evaluating applications |
| § 1002.7 | Rules on extending credit (can't require spouse signature on individual credit) |
| § 1002.9 | Notifications required (adverse action notices) |
| § 1002.10 | Furnishing of credit information (must report in both spouses' names if applicable) |
| § 1002.12 | Record retention (25 months minimum for most records) |
| § 1002.14 | Appraisal/valuation disclosures |
| § 1002.16 | Enforcement, penalties, and liabilities |

### Section 1071: Small Business Lending Data (New)

Dodd-Frank Act added ECOA § 704B requiring financial institutions to:
- Collect and report data on credit applications by women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses
- Track approval/denial rates by demographic
- Purpose: Identify and eliminate lending discrimination patterns
- Status: Rules finalized 2023, implementation ongoing amid litigation

## Business Credit Disputes

Business credit bureaus have different dispute processes than consumer bureaus.

### D&B Disputes
1. **Online:** Login to D&B Credit portal → "Dispute" on the specific trade line
2. **Phone:** 1-800-234-3867
3. **Response time:** 30–90 days (slower than consumer disputes)
4. **ECOA applies:** If D&B refuses to correct legitimate errors, you have legal recourse

### Experian Business Disputes
1. **Online:** businesscredit.experian.com → "Dispute" section
2. **Phone:** 1-800-831-5614
3. **Mail:** Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013

### Equifax Business Disputes
1. **Online:** equifax.com/business → Contact support
2. **Phone:** 1-800-727-8495

### Dispute Strategy for Business
- Same escalation path as personal: Direct dispute → Bureau dispute → CFPB → Attorney
- ECOA adverse action letters give you ammunition for disputes
- If denied credit and the reason was discriminatory, the dispute becomes a legal case
